    "## Sequence Modeling with Hidden Markov Models\n",
    "In this homework, we will work on sequence data. CpG island detection is a well-known problem in bioinformatics. There are four bases in genomes, A, C, G, and T. In some genomic regions CG bases were observed to be  significantly more common than in other regions. These CG rich regions are called CpG islands. We will not use benchmark data with CpG information. Instead, we will use an HMM model to generate our own data by providing transition and emission probabilties. HMM is a distribution depicted by a graphical model, and it is a generative model. The following diagram shows a 2 state HMM. Emission probabilities are shown in rectangles, and transition probabilities are shown in edge labels. "

This is because there are higher probability transitions going into the fair die state which causes the viterbi path to be made up of either all fair die or one loaded die to start and all fair die."
